# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS Starter

This is a starter template for a React project using TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a foundation for building responsive login and signup pages.

## Features

- React for building user interfaces
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MohammadAzhari/Had_Task
cd your-project
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and provide you with a local URL where you can view your application.

## Customization

- **Auth Page**: You can find the login page component at `src/pages/AuthPage.tsx`. Customize it according to your needs.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes are used for styling. You can modify the styles in the individual component files or edit the global styles in `src/index.css`.
